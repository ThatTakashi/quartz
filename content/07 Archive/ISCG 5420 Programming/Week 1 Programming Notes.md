[[History of Programming]]
# Types of Programming Languages:
### Low Level Languages:
These languages are closer to raw machine code, they are able to interface more efficiently with the hardware within the computer. They are however more complex to learn and write with some low level languages requiring the management of components such as memory, etc.
#### Machine Language:
Machine language is the lowest level programming language that a computer can understand. Machine language is entirely made up of 1s and 0s representing the binary value of each address in memory.

### High Level Languages:
High level languages are easier to learn than low level languages due to them having a more human readable syntax. These languages however do not boast the efficiency that low level languages do and are slower to compile.

> [!info] Conversion
> Code written in high level languages such as Python will get converted at runtime into machine code by a compiler. This process is automatic and is the reason that Python and other high level languages can be slower than low level languages.

### Scripting Languages:
These languages are used to automate repetitive tasks. Python, Perl and Ruby are all scripting languages for example.
