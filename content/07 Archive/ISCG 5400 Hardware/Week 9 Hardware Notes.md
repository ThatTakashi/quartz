- **Analogue**
	- Analogue data is in a continuous form
	- It varies smoothly
- **Digital**
	- Digital signal is discontinuous (gaps)
	- Varies in steps
	- Varies instantly
	- Represented by 1s and 0s
	- Represents exact voltages at regular time intervals
- **Conversion**
	- **Analogue to Digital (ADC)**
		- Converts a signal from analogue to digital by sampling
	- **Digital to Analogue (DAC)**
		- Converts a digital signal to an analogue signal by using the digital data to produce a corresponding voltage
		- DACs also *look ahead*. If the next sample has a *higher* level is starts increasing the output voltage to produce a smooth curve
- **Codec**
	- Many don't come standard on systems such as Windows or MacOS
	- enCode, Decoding
- **Analogue Devices**
	- Conventional camera, Most telephones, TV, Microphone, Speaker
- **Digital Devices**
	- Digital camera, GSM cellphones, Computer monitor, Keyboard
- **Input Devices**
	- **Keyboards**
		- Keyboards allow the user to type letters and control parts of a system
		- Has its own circuit
			- Two scan codes
				- One for when the key is pressed
				- And another for when the key is released
		- Special keys have a flag in a special area of memory
		- **Types of keys**
			- Metal contact keys
			- Capacitive (or flat) keys
				- Used in cheap laptops and pos systems
			- Mechanical keys
			- Membrane keys
		- **Keyboard Layouts**
			- *Dvorak*
				- Made to be more efficient to use
			- *QWERTY*
				- Converted from typewriter
				- Most common keyboard layout
				- Not the most efficient
	- **Pointing Devices**
		- Supplements the keyboard actions by doing tasks such as moving and pointing
		- **Types of mice**
			- Mechanical mouse
				- Contains a hard rubber ball that sits against two rollers
			- Opto mechanical mouse
				- Same as the mechanical mouse except
			- Optical mouse
				- No moving parts
				- Shines a small light mounted on its bottom side onto almost any type of service
			- Trackball mouse
				- Same as a mechanical mouse but upside-down
		- **Other Pointing Devices**
			- Touchpad
			- Pointing Stick
			- Joystick
