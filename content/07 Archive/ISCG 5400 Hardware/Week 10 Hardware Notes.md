- **Advantages of Digital over Analogue**
	- Less errors because of only two distinct values (1, 0)
	- Less power required because only two discrete signals
	- More efficient transmission (Switching, Multiplexing)
	- Higher maximum transmission rate
	- More secure
		- Easier to encrypt
- **Switching**
	- **Multiplexing**
		- MUX/DMUX
		- Can increase or decrease the bandwidth on demand
		- Combines multiple switches or signals into one
- **Frequency**
- **Band**
	- A range of frequencies
		- Covers a range from 80MHz to 180MHz
- **Bandwidth**
	- Bandwidth is the width of the band
	- In networks, bandwidth is used to refer to the amount of data that can be sent per second
- **Baud Rate**
	- Number of times that a signal changes per second
- **Bit Rate**
	- Bit rate is the number of bits of data sent every second
- **MoDem**
	- **Modulation**
	- **Demodulation**
	- **Moden Types**
		- Internal Modem
		- External Modem
		- PCMCIA Card
			- Express Cards
				- Better than PCMCIA Cards
		- USB Dongle Modem
		- Mobile WiFi Modem Router
		- Wireless Gateway Modem Router
- **Modulation Techniques**
	- Amplitude Modulation (AM)
		- Frequency and Phase remain constant
	- Frequency Modulation (FM)
		- Amplitude and Phase remain constant
	- Phase Modulation (PM)
		- Amplitude and Frequency remain constant
	- Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
		- A combination of Amplitude Modulation and Frequency Modulation
